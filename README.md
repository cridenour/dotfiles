#Dotfiles, bro

These are my dotfiles. Eventually, I'll come up with a more elegant way to do this.

##Themes

Terminal themes. Right now it's just an exported OS X Homebrew theme. But now I've got it. Stickin' it to the man, man.

##LICENSE

Do whatever you want with the files. Just don't sue me.  Or spam me. Or in any way negatively impact my life.
